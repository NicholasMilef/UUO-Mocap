    Computes the distance between a pointcloud and a mesh within a batch.
    Given a pair `(mesh, pcl)` in the batch, we define the distance to be the
    sum of two distances, namely `point_face(mesh, pcl) + face_point(mesh, pcl)`

    `point_face(mesh, pcl)`: Computes the squared distance of each point p in pcl
        to the closest triangular face in mesh and averages across all points in pcl
    `face_point(mesh, pcl)`: Computes the squared distance of each triangular face in
        mesh to the closest point in pcl and averages across all faces in mesh.

    The above distance functions are applied for all `(mesh, pcl)` pairs in the batch
    and then averaged across the batch.

    Args:
        meshes: A Meshes data structure containing N meshes
        pcls: A Pointclouds data structure containing N pointclouds
        min_triangle_area: (float, defaulted) Triangles of area less than this
            will be treated as points/lines.

    Returns:
        loss: The `point_face(mesh, pcl) + face_point(mesh, pcl)` distance
            between all `(mesh, pcl)` in a batch averaged across the batch.
